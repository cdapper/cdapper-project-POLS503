# cdapper-project-POLS503

# Greetings. This paper "503 draft" is essentially identical to the paper I completed in 501. Accordingly, you'll find a folder with my 501 project and draft within this file. 

# My working project for 503 is called "cdapper-project-POLS503.R" and the data, along with the codebook, is found within the "data" folder. 

# Within the R markdown file "Supplemental-Info" are some additional descriptive statistics not included in my paper for your use.

# Be advised: the only things I am adding to this paper thus far are weights, which have yet to be implemented. I also plan on considering case type, but this is yet to be determined.

# Explanations of models are found in the final paragraph of the draft.
